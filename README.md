I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by utilizing different type of testing techniques. For this project I used white-box testing and black-box testing. The JUnit testing proved 
my code was functional and verified its quality. It determined if my code handled invalid input and errors properly. Another way is by educating yourself with the different methods, objects, or classes that are 
imbedded into your application. 

I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by listening to the client interview and asking questions when things are unclear. The interview turns into requirements that I can implement into my 
program. I approach designing software with a mindset of excitement, responsibility, and determination. My job is to create the highest quality product possible for my client that meets user needs and their requirements. The software I create must be tested for functionality and security.
